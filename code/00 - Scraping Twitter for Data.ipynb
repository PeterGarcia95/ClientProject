    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "The aftermath of Hurricane Sandy led to over [8 million US people without power](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hurricane-sandy-power-outage-map-infographic_n_2044411). According to [energy.gov](https://www.energy.gov/articles/hurricane-sandy-noreaster-situation-reports), everyone who was able to recieve electricity after the storm has had their electricity restored by December 3, leaving a remainder of 26,000 people in New York and New Jersey without power. One of the methods of detecting power outages at this time was by utilizing [smart meters and Advanced Meter Infrastructures (AMI)](https://openei.org/wiki/Definition:Outage_Detection/Reporting). The problem is that these systems [will not be fully implemented until 2030](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/kbauman/research/papers/2015_KBauman_WITS.pdf) due to high cost of production. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As an alternative method of detecting these outages, we will be using natural language processsing techniques to analyze various posts from a social media platform, Twitter. When analyzing these posts, we hope to classify each post as either a post pertaining to a blackout or a post not pertaining to a blackout using supervised classification model."

    "Using `twitterscraper`, we queried for any tweet that contained at least one of the listed phrases such as \"blackout\", \"power outage\", or \"no power\". We also included phrases that may be used to describe cause-and-effect relationships with power outages such as \"hurricane\", \"blizzard\", or \"no school\". Although there is a large company named Blizzard that develops games, it will be okay to retrieve those tweets because we hope to have an even number of tweets discussing power outages and tweets that do not discuss power outages. In pursuit of that, we have included phrases that generally are not used when talking about power outages such as \"baseball\", \"hungry\", or \"food\".\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation this library has in comparison to the Twitter API is that it will scrape tweets outside the specified range if the location is not understood by `twitterscraper`. For example, our original scrape was originating from a small town in Maine and it resulted in tweets from all over the world. We noticed tweets from or mentioning the user @KenyaPower_Care and realized that this was not in the U.S. To account for this, we have specified that we do not want tweets from or mentioning this user, as well as any tweets mentioning Kenya. We have changed our location to a mjaor city, such as Boston."
